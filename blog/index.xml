      <description>How should I get there? Metro Transit (highly recommended): The green line light rail to the East Bank station is a 0.4 mile walk to Bruininks hall. There are also bus options .
Biking (highly recommended): There is a Nice Ride  station adjacent to Bruininks Hall on the 2nd level entrance to the Washington Avenue Bridge. There are also several bike parking  cages nearby (U-locks are a must have for safe bike lock-up).</description>

      <description>noRth is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our event(s). noRth is a conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community. We encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group.
A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice.</description>
