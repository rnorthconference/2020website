PANDEMIC UPDATE (3-17-2020) We are carefully monitoring the situation and will provide a decision with regard to the conference by late April 2020. No registration will be done prior to that date. Thanks for your patience. Stay safe and do what you can to flatten the curve!
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you an intermediate or advanced R user looking for an opportunity to expand your knowledge and connect with the diverse R community in the Twin Cities? We'd love for you to join us at noRth 2020! 

The conference consists of a half-day short course (July 14) and a day of interactive talks (July 15). The conference will be held in <a href="https://campusmaps.umn.edu/robert-h-bruininks-hall">Bruininks Hall</a> on the campus of the University of Minnesota.

The seminar day will consist of two plenary talks and breakout options for four additional talks. Bring your laptop and come ready to learn.
